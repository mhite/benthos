:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.

Downloads objects within a Google Cloud Storage bucket, optionally filtered by a prefix, either by walking the items in the bucket or by streaming upload notifications in realtime.

Introduced in version 3.43.0.

## Streaming Objects on Upload with Pub/Sub

A common pattern for consuming GCS objects is to configure a bucket to emit upload notification events to a Pub/Sub topic with an associated subscription. A consumer then subscribes to this subscription and newly uploaded objects are then downloaded as notification events are published to the subscription. More information about this pattern and how to set it up can be found at: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/pubsub-notifications.

Benthos is able to follow this pattern when you configure `pubsub.project` and `pubsub.subscription`, where it consumes events from Pub/Sub and only downloads object keys received within those events.

When using Pub/Sub please make sure you have sensible values for `pubsub.max_outstanding_messages` and also the acknowledgement deadline of the subscription itself. When Benthos consumes a GCS object the Pub/Sub message that triggered it is not acknowledged until the GCS object has been sent onwards. This ensures at-least-once crash resiliency, but also means that if the GCS object takes longer to process than the acknowledgement deadline of your subscription then the same objects might be processed multiple times.

## Downloading Large Files

When downloading large files it's often necessary to process it in streamed parts in order to avoid loading the entire file in memory at a given time. In order to do this a [`codec`](#codec) can be specified that determines how to break the input into smaller individual messages.

## Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```
- gcs_key
- gcs_bucket
- gcs_last_modified
- gcs_last_modified_unix
- gcs_content_type
- gcs_content_encoding
- All user defined metadata
```

You can access these metadata fields using [function interpolation](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).

### Credentials

By default Benthos will use a shared credentials file when connecting to GCP
services. You can find out more [in this document](/docs/guides/cloud/gcp).

## Fields

### `pubsub`

Consume Pub/Sub messages in order to trigger key downloads.


Type: `object`  

### `pubsub.project`

The project ID of the target subscription.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `pubsub.subscription`

The target subscription ID.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `pubsub.sync`

Enable synchronous pull mode.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `pubsub.max_outstanding_messages`

The maximum number of outstanding pending messages to be consumed at a given time.


Type: `int`  
Default: `1000`  

### `pubsub.max_outstanding_bytes`

The maximum number of outstanding pending messages to be consumed measured in bytes.


Type: `int`  
Default: `1000000000`  

### `bucket`

The name of the bucket from which to download objects.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `prefix`

An optional path prefix, if set only objects with the prefix are consumed.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `codec`

The way in which the bytes of a data source should be converted into discrete messages, codecs are useful for specifying how large files or continuous streams of data might be processed in small chunks rather than loading it all in memory. It's possible to consume lines using a custom delimiter with the `delim:x` codec, where x is the character sequence custom delimiter. Codecs can be chained with `/`, for example a gzip compressed CSV file can be consumed with the codec `gzip/csv`.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"all-bytes"`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `auto` | EXPERIMENTAL: Attempts to derive a codec for each file based on information such as the extension. For example, a .tar.gz file would be consumed with the `gzip/tar` codec. Defaults to all-bytes. |
| `all-bytes` | Consume the entire file as a single binary message. |
| `avro-ocf:marshaler=x` | EXPERIMENTAL: Consume a stream of Avro OCF datum. The `marshaler` parameter is optional and has the options: `goavro` (default), `json`. Use `goavro` if OCF contains logical types. |
| `chunker:x` | Consume the file in chunks of a given number of bytes. |
| `csv` | Consume structured rows as comma separated values, the first row must be a header row. |
| `csv:x` | Consume structured rows as values separated by a custom delimiter, the first row must be a header row. The custom delimiter must be a single character, e.g. the codec `"csv:\t"` would consume a tab delimited file. |
| `delim:x` | Consume the file in segments divided by a custom delimiter. |
| `gzip` | Decompress a gzip file, this codec should precede another codec, e.g. `gzip/all-bytes`, `gzip/tar`, `gzip/csv`, etc. |
| `lines` | Consume the file in segments divided by linebreaks. |
| `multipart` | Consumes the output of another codec and batches messages together. A batch ends when an empty message is consumed. For example, the codec `lines/multipart` could be used to consume multipart messages where an empty line indicates the end of each batch. |
| `regex:(?m)^\d\d:\d\d:\d\d` | Consume the file in segments divided by regular expression. |
| `tar` | Parse the file as a tar archive, and consume each file of the archive as a message. |


```yml
# Examples

codec: lines

codec: "delim:\t"

codec: delim:foobar

codec: gzip/csv
```

### `delete_objects`

Whether to delete downloaded objects from the bucket once they are processed.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `max_buffer`

The largest token size expected when consuming objects with a tokenised codec such as `lines`.


Type: `int`  
Default: `1000000`
